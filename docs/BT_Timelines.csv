In the end the Wolves won out, retaining the Di Napoli complex and repulsing Sandoval’s forces.",,,,,,,
Era Digest: Dark Age,6,3132,,,,,,"Dieron: One of the frst major actions after the Blackout was also one of the messiest. An assault on the capital city by Katana Tormark’s forces was initially blocked by Republic troops escorting Exarch Redburn to a trade summit with saKhan Ya’el Labov of the Sea Fox’s Fox Khanate. The addition of local Steiner-loyalist troops only served to muddy the waters, as did a series of terror attacks by local anarchists and secessionists. After nearly a month of fghting, the Republic retained possession of Dieron. Assisting the Exarch for part of this defense was Anastasia Kerensky, new ly arrived in Republic territory and going by the name Tassa Kay.",,,,,,,

The Legion landed on 24 November and in a three-day battle succeeded in forcing the Fury out, though not without some unfortunate damage to the nearby city.",,,,,,,

Fighting continued from September into December until the Dragon’s Fury ultimately emerged victorious and made an alliance with the planetary government to safeguard the planet. With resources stretched thin, Terra tacitly allowed this state of a?airs in order to free up troops for service elsewhere while tying down most of the Fury’s Brotherhood regiment.",,,,,,,
